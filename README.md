Introduction 

❖ Purpose of the Simulation:
The primary purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate and analyze the sequential procedures that a User Equipment (UE) undergoes to establish connectivity with a 5G network, from power-on to the acquisition of a default bearer. This involves simulating various key processes defined in the 3GPP TS 123 502 standard, which are critical for the UE's ability to access network services effectively.

❖ Scope of the Simulation: Outline the steps covered in the simulation, including the four major steps:

➢ Initial Access Procedure

➢ Radio Resource Control (RRC) Setup

➢ Initial Registration Procedure

➢ UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
